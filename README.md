# Ciphers
This is a project to implement different crypto systems.
The crypto system ciphers would be gradually added and a short notes on how they are implemented would be updated below

# Preprocess Data
The preprocess function is to read data from a file and performs a regular expression search to do below 
remove special characters, convert the upper case to lower case remove spaces 
Finally returns a string of lower case alphabetic characters (a-z)


# Shift Cipher 
This is a special case of substitution cipher. Decrypt and encrypt functions would accept a key and a text as params
Encrypt and Decrypt functions would return encrypted text and decrypted text respectively


# Affine Cipher
This is another special case of substitution cipher. Decrypt and Encrypt functions would take 2 keys and a text as params
Encrypt and Decrypt functions would return encrypted text and decrypted text respectively


# Vigenere Cipher
This is also another special case of subsitution cipher. Decrypt and Encrypt functions would take a string as key and a text
Encrypt and Decrypt functions would return encrypted text and decrypted text respectively
